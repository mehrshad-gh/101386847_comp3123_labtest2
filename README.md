## Introduction

Congratulations on reaching my ReactJS application for the lab test! This application utilizes React features such as state, hooks, and Axios to fetch and display weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The UI incorporates icons and dynamic content change features to enhance the user experience.

## Features

1. **Weather Data Display:** The application fetches weather data for Toronto on initial load and displays relevant information.

2. **Dynamic Content Change:** Users can input a city in the search bar, and the application dynamically updates to fetch and display weather data for the specified location.

3. **Weather Icons:** Icons representing weather conditions are integrated into the UI to provide visual cues.

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
